# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analytics & Visualization Project

## 📌 Overview

This project explores the COVID-19 pandemic using data analytics and machine learning. By leveraging multiple datasets—**confirmed cases**, **death reports**, **vaccination & population data**, and **Twitter data**—the project aims to uncover trends, visualize insights, and understand the broader trajectory of the pandemic.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📥 Store data in **MongoDB** for flexible access and **PostgreSQL** for relational analysis.
- 🧹 Preprocess data using **Pandas** in **Jupyter Notebook**.
- 📊 Apply regression models (linear, polynomial, time-series) with **Scikit-Learn**.
- 📈 Visualize trends using tools like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Folium**, and **WordCloud**.
- 🧪 Analyze COVID-19 trends across multiple metrics including tweets and vaccination rates.
- 🧠 Evaluate results and propose future directions.
